  <h2>How a Random Wheel Helped Me Break Decision Fatigue</h2>
  <p>Every day, we’re faced with countless decisions — what to eat, what task to prioritize, which movie to watch, or even who should go first in a group activity. This constant stream of choices can lead to what psychologists call “decision fatigue.”</p>
  <p>One evening, tired of arguing with friends about what to order for dinner, I pulled up a random wheel online and entered all our options. With a spin and a click, the decision was made — and to everyone’s surprise, it felt fun and fair.</p>
  <p>Since then, I’ve used the random wheel for everything from planning chores to choosing daily workouts. It eliminates bias, reduces stress, and adds a playful twist to ordinary tasks.</p>
  <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you’re overwhelmed by options, try listing them all and letting the wheel decide. Sometimes, the best choice is the one you don’t have to make yourself.</p>
